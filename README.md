# New York State Arrest and Prison Sentence Analysis
I analyzed the New York State 2018 arrest data to see if racial diparities exist. Analysis included adjusting for county population data and racial demographics of counties in which persons were arrested or sentenced to prison.
I found that black people are arrested and sentenced to prison dispropotionately high compared to every other demographic group. This is true especially for counties with high white population (>50%). Conversely, in counties where black people make up more than 10% of the total population black people are arrested less and yield fewer prison sentences per arrest.
This suggest that disproportionately high arrest and prison sentences of black people is due to racial biases against black people in counties with high white/ low black population.
